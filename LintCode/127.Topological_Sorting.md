# 127. Topological Sorting

#### [link](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/topological-sorting/description)

#### Description
Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

* For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
* The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.

Find any topological order for the given graph.

#### Note
* You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.

#### Example:
For graph as follow:

The topological order can be:
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
...
```

#### Challenge
Can you do it in both BFS and DFS?

## BFS
```java
/**
 * Definition for Directed graph.
 * class DirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     ArrayList<DirectedGraphNode> neighbors;
 *     DirectedGraphNode(int x) { label = x; neighbors = new ArrayList<DirectedGraphNode>(); }
 * };
 */

public class Solution {
    /*
     * @param graph: A list of Directed graph node
     * @return: Any topological order for the given graph.
     */
    public ArrayList<DirectedGraphNode> topSort(ArrayList<DirectedGraphNode> graph) {
        Map<DirectedGraphNode, Integer> nodeToIndegree = new HashMap<>();
        Deque<DirectedGraphNode> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        ArrayList<DirectedGraphNode> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for(DirectedGraphNode now : graph){
            for(DirectedGraphNode next : now.neighbors){
                nodeToIndegree.compute(next, (k, v) -> v == null ? 1 : v + 1);
            }
        }
        for(DirectedGraphNode now : graph){
            if(!nodeToIndegree.containsKey(now)){
                queue.addLast(now);
            }
        }
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            DirectedGraphNode now = queue.removeFirst();
            ans.add(now);
            for(DirectedGraphNode next : now.neighbors){
                nodeToIndegree.compute(next, (k, v) -> v - 1);
                if(nodeToIndegree.get(next) == 0){
                    queue.addLast(next);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
