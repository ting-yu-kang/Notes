# 1380. Log Sorting

#### [link](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/log-sorting/description)

#### Description
Given a list of string `logs`, in which each element representing a log. Each log can be separated into two parts by the first space. The first part is the ID of the log, while the second part is the content of the log. (The content may contain spaces as well.) The content is composed of only letters and spaces, or only numbers and spaces.

Now you need to sort `logs` by following rules:

1. Logs whose content is letter should be ahead of logs whose content is number.
3. Logs whose content is letter should be sorted by their content in lexicographic order. And when two logs have same content, sort them by ID in lexicographic order.
4. Logs whose content is number should be in their input order.

#### Notice
1. The total number of logs will not exceed `5000`
2. The length of each log will not exceed `100`
3. Each log's ID is unique.

#### Example 1:
```
Input:  
    logs = [
        "zo4 4 7",
        "a100 Act zoo",
        "a1 9 2 3 1",
        "g9 act car"
    ]
Output: 
    [
        "a100 Act zoo",
        "g9 act car",
        "zo4 4 7",
        "a1 9 2 3 1"
    ]
Explanation: "Act zoo" < "act car", so the output is as above.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input:  
    logs = [
        "zo4 4 7",
        "a100 Actzoo",
        "a100 Act zoo",
        "Tac Bctzoo",
        "Tab Bctzoo",
        "g9 act car"
    ]
Output: 
    [
        "a100 Act zoo",
        "a100 Actzoo",
        "Tab Bctzoo",
        "Tac Bctzoo",
        "g9 act car",
        "zo4 4 7"
    ]
Explanation:
    Because "Bctzoo" == "Bctzoo", the comparison "Tab" and "Tac" have "Tab" < Tac ", so" Tab Bctzoo "< Tac Bctzoo".
    Because ' '<'z', so "A100 Act zoo" < A100 Actzoo".
```

## Sort
```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param logs: the logs
     * @return: the log after sorting
     */
    public String[] logSort(String[] logs) {
        String[] ans = new String[logs.length];
        List<String[]> letterList = new ArrayList<>();
        int ansIdx = logs.length - 1;
        for(int i = logs.length - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
            String log = logs[i];
            int spaceIdx = log.indexOf(' ');
            if(spaceIdx == -1)
                throw new IllegalArgumentException();
            String id = log.substring(0, spaceIdx);
            String content = log.substring(spaceIdx + 1, log.length());
            if(Character.isDigit(content.trim().charAt(0)))
                ans[ansIdx--] = log;
            else{
                String[] pair = new String[2];
                pair[0] = id;
                pair[1] = content;
                letterList.add(pair);
            }
        }
        
        Collections.sort(letterList, (a, b) -> a[1].equals(b[1]) ?  a[0].compareTo(b[0]) : a[1].compareTo(b[1]));
        ansIdx = 0;
        for(String[] letterPair : letterList){
            ans[ansIdx++] = letterPair[0] + " " + letterPair[1];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(nlog(n))
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* for number list, copy from the end to top
* for letter list, split into two parts and do comparison
