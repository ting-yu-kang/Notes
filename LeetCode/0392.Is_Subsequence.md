# 392. Is Subsequence

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

#### Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` *if `s` is a **subsequence** of `t`, or `false` otherwise*.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:
`0 <= s.length <= 100`
`0 <= t.length <= 104`
`s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

#### Follow up:
Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 109`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Ans: Put char->list of index. And for each substring, choose the least possible index.

## Two pointer
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
            
        now = 0
        for c in t:
            if c == s[now]:
                now += 1
                if now == len(s):
                    return True

        return False
```
### Time complexity
* O(n), n is the length of t
### Space complexity
* O(1)
