# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

#### Description
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their *longest **common subsequence***. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings

#### Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
* `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.\

## Dynamic Programming
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        n1, n2 = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [[0 for j in range(n2 + 1)] for i in range(n1 + 1)]

        for i in range(1, n1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        return dp[n1][n2]
```
### Time complexity
* O(m * n)
### Space complexity
* O(m * n)
### Remark
* For 2 substrings:
    * if their last character is the same, then they must be included in the final answer: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]`
    * if their last character is not the same, then either one of them will not be included in the final answer: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])`

## Dynamic Programming 1D
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        if len(text1) < len(text2):
            text1, text2 = text2, text1

        n1, n2 = len(text1), len(text2)
        prev = [0 for j in range(n2 + 1)]
        cur = [0 for j in range(n2 + 1)]

        for i in range(1, n1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    cur[j] = prev[j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    cur[j] = max(prev[j], cur[j - 1]) 
            prev, cur = cur, prev

        return prev[n2]
```
### Time complexity
* O(m * n)
### Space complexity
* O(min(m, n))
