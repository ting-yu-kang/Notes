# 295. Find Median from Data Stream

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/) 

#### Description
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,\
`[2,3,4]`, the median is `3`

`[2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

* void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
* double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.


#### Example:
```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
```

#### Follow up:

1. If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
2. If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?

## Double Priority Queue
```java
class MedianFinder {

    PriorityQueue<Integer> left; //MaxHeap
    PriorityQueue<Integer> right; //MinHeap
    
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    public MedianFinder() {
        left = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        right = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a - b);
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        left.offer(num);
        right.offer(left.poll());
        if(right.size() > left.size())
            left.offer(right.poll());
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        if(left.size() == right.size()){
            return ((double) left.peek() + (double) right.peek()) / 2;
        }
        else{
            return (double) left.peek();
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
 */
```

### Time complexity
* Insert: O(log(n))
* findMedian: O(1)

### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* Always let `left.size() == right.size()` or `left.size() == right.size() + 1`
* Trade off between fast insertion and fast median find.
* Another trick: negating elements of right half so that both halves can be max-heaps (default of java).

* Insertion sort: 
    * Add: O(n)
    * getMedian: O(1)
* Do nothing
    * Add: O(1)
    * getMedian: O(nlog(n))
