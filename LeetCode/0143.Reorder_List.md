# 143. Reorder List

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

#### Description
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
```
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
```
*Reorder the list to be on the following form:*
```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
```
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        slow = fast = head

        # find the middle point
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        # reverse second half
        prev = None
        now = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        while now:
            next = now.next
            now.next = prev
            prev = now
            now = next
        
        # connect both lists
        now_1 = head
        now_2 = prev

        # now_1 -> next_1
        # now_2 -> next_2
        while now_2:
            next_1 = now_1.next
            now_1.next = now_2
            next_2 = now_2.next
            now_2.next = next_1
            now_1 = next_1
            now_2 = next_2

        return head
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Reverse second half and merge
