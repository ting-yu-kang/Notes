# 62. Unique Paths

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

#### Description
There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`

## Dynamic Programming 2D
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            dp[0][j] = 1

        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]

        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```

## Math
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return math.factorial(m + n - 2) // (math.factorial(m - 1) * math.factorial(n - 1))
```
### Time complexity
* O((M + N)(log(M + N)loglog(M + N))^2)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
