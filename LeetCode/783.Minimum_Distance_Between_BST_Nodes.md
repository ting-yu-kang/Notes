# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/) 

#### Description
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

#### Example:
```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

#### Note:
1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

## DFS
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    Integer min, last;
    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        last = null;
        min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        dfs(root);
        return min;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode root){
        if(root.left != null){
            dfs(root.left);
        }
        if(last != null){
            min = Math.min(min, root.val - last);
        }
        last = root.val;
        if(root.right != null){
            dfs(root.right);
        }
    }
}
```
