# 212. Word Search II

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

#### Description
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

#### Example:
```
Input: 
board = [
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]

Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

#### Note:
All inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
The values of words are distinct.

### Time Complexity
* O(M*N * 3^LEN) ,LEN is the longest word's length
### Space Complexity
* O(K * LEN), Trie. 
* K: number of words ; the worst case is that there are no common prefix between each word.
### Remark
* If we repreat the 079 for each word, it will cause a lot of time as well as duplicate looking up.
* By using trie, when finding a path, we are also finding the word in the trie, it will effectely reduce the overhead.
* The most magical improvement is that, the time complexity is similar as onle the one word. However it still need some time to build trie.
* To remove duplicate, just set the s to be null so that it will never be valid, awesome!
