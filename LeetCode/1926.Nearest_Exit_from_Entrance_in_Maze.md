# 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/)

#### Description
You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the `entrance`. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count** as an exit.

Return *the **number of steps** in the shortest path from the `entrance` to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists*.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearesr2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
```
#### Example 3:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest3-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no exits in this maze.
```

#### Constraints:
* `maze.length == m`
* `maze[i].length == n`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `maze[i][j] is either '.' or '+'.`
* `entrance.length == 2`
* `0 <= entrancerow < m`
* `0 <= entrancecol < n`
* `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

                if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= m or y >= n:
                    continue
                if maze[x][y] != ".":
                    continue
                if (x == 0 or y == 0 or x == m - 1 or y == n - 1) and (x != entrance[0] or y != entrance[1]):
                    return step
                maze[x][y] = "*"
                for d0, d1 in directions:
                    queue.append((x + d0, y + d1))

            step += 1
            
        return -1
