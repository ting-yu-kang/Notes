# 994. Rotting Oranges

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

#### Description
You are given an `m x n ``grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

* `0` representing an empty cell,
* `1` representing a fresh orange, or
* `2` representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return *the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.* If *this is impossible, return* `-1`.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

#### Constraints:
* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10`
* `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

                    continue
                if grid[x][y] == 1:
                    grid[x][y] = 2
                    fresh -= 1
                    if fresh == 0:
                        return minute
                if grid[x][y] == 2:
                    for d0, d1 in directions:
                        queue.append((x + d0, y + d1))
                    grid[x][y] = 0

            minute += 1

        return -1
