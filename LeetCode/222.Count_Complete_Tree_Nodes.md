# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/) 

#### Description
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

#### Note:

**Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

#### Example:
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

## DFS
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        int left = dfs(root.left);
        int right = dfs(root.right);
        return left + right + 1;
    }
}
```

### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(log(n))
