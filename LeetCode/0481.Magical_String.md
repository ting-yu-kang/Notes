# 481. Magical String

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/magical-string/)

#### Description
A magical string **S** consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string **S** is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string **S** itself.

The first few elements of string **S** is the following: **S** = "1221121221221121122……"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in **S**, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2	2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the **S** itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string **S**.

#### Note
N will not exceed 100,000.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int candidate = 1;
        int index = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int count = 0;    
        
        while(end < n){
            int now = index == end ? candidate : dp[index];
            for(int i = 0 ; i < now ; i++){
                dp[end++] = candidate;
                if(candidate == 1)
                     count++;
                if(end == n)
                    return count;
            }
            index++;
            candidate = 3 - candidate;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
