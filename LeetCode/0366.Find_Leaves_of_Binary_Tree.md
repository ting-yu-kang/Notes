#### Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

* Collect all the leaf nodes.
* Remove all the leaf nodes.
* Repeat until the tree is empty.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution
```python
```
### Time complexity
* O()
### Space complexity
* O()
### Remark

for i in range
