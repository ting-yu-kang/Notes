# 197. Rising Temperature

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/)

#### Description

##### Table: `Weather`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
```

Write a solution to find all dates' `id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```
## JOIN
```sql
SELECT
    W1.id
FROM
    Weather W1
JOIN
    Weather W2
ON
    W1.recordDate = W2.recordDate + INTERVAL 1 DAY
WHERE
    W1.temperature > W2.temperature
```

## LAG
```sql
WITH Weather_with_last AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        recordDate,
        temperature,
        LAG(recordDate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_recordDate,
        LAG(temperature, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temperature
    FROM
        Weather
)

SELECT
    id
FROM
    Weather_with_last
WHERE
    temperature > prev_temperature
    AND
    recordDate = prev_recordDate + INTERVAL 1 DAY
```
