# 605. Can Place Flowers

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

#### Description
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` *if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise*.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## Sol1
```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0:
            return True

        plant = 0
        for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
            if (
                flowerbed[i] == 0 and
                (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) and 
                (i == len(flowerbed) - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)
            ):
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                plant += 1
                if plant == n:
                    return True

        return False
```
