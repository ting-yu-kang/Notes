# 647. Palindromic Substrings

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

#### Description
Given a string `s`, return *the number of **palindromic substrings** in it.*

A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Two Pointers
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            left, right = i, i
            while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
                count += 1
                left -= 1
                right += 1

            left, right = i, i + 1
            while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
                count += 1
                left -= 1
                right += 1

        return count
```
### Time complexity
* O(n^2)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Can also do dp
