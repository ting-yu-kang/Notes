# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

#### Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:**

* You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
* The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4`
* `0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4`

        if now == len(self.prices) - 1:
            if hold:
                return self.prices[now] - self.fee
            else:
                return 0

        if self.memory[hold][now] != self.MIN:
            return self.memory[hold][now]

        #buy
        if not hold:
            profit_trade = -self.prices[now] + self.__cal_profit(now + 1, True)
        #sell
        else:
            profit_trade = self.prices[now] - self.fee + self.__cal_profit(now + 1, False)

        #do nothing
        profit_skip = self.__cal_profit(now + 1, hold)

        profit = max(profit_trade, profit_skip)
        self.memory[hold][now] = profit
        return profit

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n)] for _ in range(2)]
        dp[1][n - 1] = prices[n - 1] - fee

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            dp[0][i] = max(-prices[i] + dp[1][i + 1], dp[0][i + 1])
            dp[1][i] = max(prices[i] - fee + dp[0][i + 1], dp[1][i + 1])

        return dp[0][0]
```
### Time complexity

### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* On n - 1 day, if we hold the stock, we have no choice but to sell it.
