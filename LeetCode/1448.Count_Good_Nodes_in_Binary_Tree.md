# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/)

#### Description
Given a binary tree `root`, a node `X` in the tree is named **good** if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value *greater than `X`*.

Return the number of **good** nodes in the binary tree.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)
```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
* Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## DFS
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        return self.__dfs(root, root.val)

    def __dfs(self, now, max_val):
        if not now:
            return 0

        count = 0
        if now.val >= max_val:
            count = 1
            max_val = now.val

        return count + self.__dfs(now.left, max_val) + self.__dfs(now.right, max_val)
```
