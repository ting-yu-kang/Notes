# 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/)

#### Description
In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is **even**, the `ith` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the `(n-1-i)th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

* For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return *the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list*.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg1drawio.png)
```
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
```
#### Example 2:
![](![alt text](image-1.png))
```
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 
```
#### Example 3:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg3drawio.png)
```
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        fast = head
        slow = head
        prev = None

        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next

            next = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = next
        
        right_head = slow
        left_head = prev

        max_sum = 0
        while right_head:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, left_head.val + right_head.val)
            right_head = right_head.next
            left_head = left_head.next

        return max_sum
