# 191. Number of 1 Bits

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

#### Description
Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of **set bits** in its binary representation (also known as the **Hamming weight**).

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

#### Follow up: 
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Shift
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n != 0:
            if n & 1:
                count += 1
            n >>= 1

        return count
```
### Time complexity
* O(logn)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark

## Rightmost set bit
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n != 0:
            if n & 1:
                count += 1
            n >>= 1

        return count
```
### Time complexity
* O(logn)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Trick: `n & n - 1` will remove the right most set bit
