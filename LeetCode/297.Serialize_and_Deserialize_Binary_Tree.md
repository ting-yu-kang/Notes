# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

#### Description
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

#### Example:
```
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
```

#### Clarification: 
The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

#### Note: 
Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## DFS
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Codec {
    
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return "null,";
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        dfsSerialize(root, sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }

    private void dfsSerialize(TreeNode root, StringBuilder sb){
        if(root == null){
            sb.append("null,");
            return;
        }
        sb.append(root.val + ",");
        dfsSerialize(root.left, sb);
        dfsSerialize(root.right, sb);
    }
    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    int start;
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        start = 0;
        String[] array = data.split(",");
        return dfsDeserialize(array);
    }
    
    private TreeNode dfsDeserialize(String[] array){
        if(array[start].equals("null")){
            start++;
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode now = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(array[start]));
        start++;
        now.left = dfsDeserialize(array);
        now.right = dfsDeserialize(array);
        return now;
    }
}

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec = new Codec();
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
```
