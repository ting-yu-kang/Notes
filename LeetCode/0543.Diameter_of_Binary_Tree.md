# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

#### Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the length of the **diameter** of the tree*.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.diameter = 0
        self.__dfs(root)
        return self.diameter
    
    def __dfs(self, now):
        left, right = 0, 0
        if now.left:
            left = 1 + max(self.__dfs(now.left))
        if now.right:
            right = 1 + max(self.__dfs(now.right))
        self.diameter = max(self.diameter, left + right)
        return (left, right)
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n), unbalanced tree
### Remark
* Keep updating the global paramater `self.diameter` when traversing the tree.
