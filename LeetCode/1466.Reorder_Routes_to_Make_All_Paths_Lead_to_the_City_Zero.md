# 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/)

#### Description
There are n cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a road from city `ai` to city `bi`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_1_1819.png)
```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_2_1819.png)
```
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:
* `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* `connections.length == n - 1`
* `connections[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
* `ai != bi`

## DFS
```python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = {}
        self.changed_edges = 0

        for a, b in connections:
            if a not in graph:
                graph[a] = []
            if b not in graph:
                graph[b] = []
            graph[a].append((b, 1))
            graph[b].append((a, -1))

        self.__dfs(0, graph, None)
        return self.changed_edges

    def __dfs(self, now, graph, parent):
        if now not in graph:
            return

        for city, direction in graph[now]:
            if city == parent:
                if direction == -1:
                    self.changed_edges += 1
            else:
                self.__dfs(city, graph, now)
```
### Time complexity
* O(V + E) = O(N)
* Tree has n-1 edges
### Space complexity
* O(N)
### Remark
* It's a tree, so just traverse the tree and find any reversed edges.
