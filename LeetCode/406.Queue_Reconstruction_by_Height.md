# 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

#### Description
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

#### Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

#### Example:
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

## Sol1
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> b[0] == a[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0]);
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int[] person : people){
            list.add(person[1], person);
        }
        for(int i = 0 ; i < list.size() ; i++){
            people[i] = list.get(i);
        }
        return people;
    }
}
```

### Time complexity
* O(n^2)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* Sort, and then insert the corresponding position
