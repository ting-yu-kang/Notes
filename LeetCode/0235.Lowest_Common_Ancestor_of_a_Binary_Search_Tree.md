# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/) 

#### Description
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the **definition of LCA on Wikipedia**: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

## Iteration
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p == q)
            return p;
        
        TreeNode now = root;
        while(now != null){
            if(p.val < now.val && q.val < now.val)
                now = now.left;
            else if(p.val > now.val && q.val > now.val)
                now = now.right;
            else
                return now;
        }
        
        return null;
    }
}
```
