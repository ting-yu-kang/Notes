#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/)

#### Description

##### Table: `Customer`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
```

Find the names of the customer that are either:

1. **referred by** any customer with `id != 2`.
2. **not referred by** any customer.
Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

## Solution
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    name
FROM
    Customer
WHERE
    referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL
```
