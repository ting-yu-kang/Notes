# 1268. Search Suggestions System

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)

#### Description
You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return *a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"].
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"].
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
Explanation: The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
* `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`
* All the strings of `products` are **unique**.
* `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
* `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Trie
```python
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Build Trie
        root = TrieNode()
        for product in products:
            now = root
            for c in product:
                if not now.next[ord(c) - ord("a")]:
                    now.next[ord(c) - ord("a")] = TrieNode()
                now = now.next[ord(c) - ord("a")]
            now.is_word = True

        # Build suggestions
        ret = []
        now = root
        word_list = []
        for c in searchWord:
            if not now.next[ord(c) - ord("a")]:
                break
            now = now.next[ord(c) - ord("a")]
            word_list.append(c)
            suggestion = []
            self.__find_words(now, word_list, suggestion)
            ret.append(suggestion)

        ret += [[] for _ in range(len(searchWord) - len(ret))]
        return ret

    def __find_words(self, now, word_list, suggestion):
        if len(suggestion) == 3:
            return
        if now.is_word:
            suggestion.append("".join(word_list))

        for i, next in enumerate(now.next):
            if not next:
                continue
            word_list.append(chr(i + ord("a")))
            self.__find_words(next, word_list, suggestion)
            word_list.pop()

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.next = [ None ] * 26
        self.is_word = False
```
### Time complexity
* O(n), n is total number of characters to build the trie
* O(m * n), m is length of search word, and for each search the worst case is 3 * O(n), deep tree.
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* Stop search when the result length equals to 3
* To add array of empty arrays, use for loop. Don't use [[]] * n. It will create n pointers to same elements for mutable type

## Binary Search
```python
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        left, right = 0, len(products)
        ret = []
        for i, char in enumerate(searchWord):
            left_now = self.__binary_search_left(products, left, right, char, i)
            right_now = self.__binary_search_right(products, left, right, char, i)
            ret.append(products[left_now : min(left_now + 3, right_now)])
            left, right = left_now, right_now

        return ret

    def __binary_search_left(self, arr, left, right, char, i):
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if i < len(arr[mid]) and char <= arr[mid][i]:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left

    def __binary_search_right(self, arr, left, right, char, i):
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if i < len(arr[mid]) and char < arr[mid][i]:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```
### Time complexity
* O((n + m) * log(n)), m is length of search word, and n is # of products
* O(nlogn) for sorting products
* O(mlogn) for searching
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Use left and right binary search to determine the range
* Keep doing so on the previous range and find the candidates
* It only compares one character at a time for binary search, so O(1) for comparison

## Two Pointers
```python
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        left, right = 0, len(products) - 1
        ret = []
        for i, char in enumerate(searchWord):
            while left <= right:
                if i >= len(products[left]) or products[left][i] < char:
                    left += 1
                elif i < len(products[right]) and products[right][i] > char:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    break
            if left > right:
                break
            ret.append(products[left : min(left + 3, right + 1)])

        return ret + [[] for _ in range(len(searchWord) - len(ret))]
```
### Time complexity
* O(nlog(n) + n), m is length of search word, and n is # of products
* O(nlogn) for sorting products
* O(n) for searching

### Space complexity
* O(1)

### Remark
* This could be faster then 2 binary search, as we need m * O(logn) binary search versus O(n) for two pointers, depending on the length of search word and # of products.
