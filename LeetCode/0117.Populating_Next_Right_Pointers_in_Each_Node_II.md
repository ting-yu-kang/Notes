# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)

#### Description
Given a binary tree

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

#### Example:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)
```
Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}

Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"5"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":1}

Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
```

#### Note:
You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## Traverse
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node next;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _left,Node _right,Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        Node now = root;
        Node nextLevelLeft = null;
        Node prev = null;
        while(now != null){
            if(now.left != null){
                if(prev == null){
                    nextLevelLeft = now.left;
                }
                else{
                    prev.next = now.left;
                }
                prev = now.left;
            }
            if(now.right != null){
                if(prev == null){
                    nextLevelLeft = now.right;
                }
                else{
                    prev.next = now.right;
                }
                prev = now.right;
            }
            
            if(now.next == null){
                now = nextLevelLeft;
                prev = null;
                nextLevelLeft = null;
            }
            else{
                now = now.next;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* if this level still can traverse, traverse this level to link the node on next level
* if not, got to the left node of next level
