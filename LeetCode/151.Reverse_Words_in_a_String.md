# 151. Reverse Words in a String

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

#### Description
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 104`
* `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
* There is **at least one** word in `s`.

#### Note:
* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

#### Follow up:
For C programmers, try to solve it *in-place* in O(1) extra space.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        int start = 0;
        boolean isWord = false;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        List<String> wordList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i <= s.length() ; i++){
            if(i == s.length() || s.charAt(i) == ' '){
                if(isWord){
                    wordList.add(s.substring(start, i));
                    isWord = false;
                }
            }
            else{
                if(!isWord){
                    isWord = true;
                    start = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = wordList.size() - 1 ; i >= 0 ; i--){
            String word = wordList.get(i);
            sb.append(word);
            if(i > 0)
                sb.append(" ");
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* use isWord and start to keep track of word.

## Solution (Python)
```Python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split()
        left, right = 0, len(words) - 1
        while left < right:
            words[left], words[right] = words[right], words[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

        return " ".join(words)
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* s.split() is different from s.split(" ")
