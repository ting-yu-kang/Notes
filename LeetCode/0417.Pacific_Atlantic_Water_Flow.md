# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

#### Description
There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return *a **2D list** of grid coordinates `result` where `result[i] = [ri, ci]` denotes that rain water can flow from cell `(ri, ci)` to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.*

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/waterflow-grid.jpg)
```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

#### Constraints:
* `m == heights.length`
* `n == heights[r].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 105`

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        memo_1 = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        memo_2 = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        queue_1 = deque()
        queue_2 = deque()

        for i in range(m):
            queue_1.append((i, 0))
            queue_2.append((i, n - 1))
        for j in range(n):
            queue_1.append((0, j))
            queue_2.append((m - 1, j))

        self.__bfs(queue_1, memo_1, heights)
        self.__bfs(queue_2, memo_2, heights)

        ret = []
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if memo_1[i][j] == 1 and memo_2[i][j] == 1:
                    ret.append([i, j])

        return ret

    def __bfs(self, queue, memo, heights):
        m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        while(queue):
            i, j = queue.popleft()
            h = heights[i][j]
            memo[i][j] = 1

            for dx, dy in directions:
                next_i, next_j = i + dx, j + dy
                if next_i >= m or next_i < 0 or next_j >= n or next_j < 0:
                    continue
                if memo[next_i][next_j] == 1:
                    continue
                if heights[next_i][next_j] < h:
                    continue
                queue.append((next_i, next_j))
            
```
