# 11. Container With Most Water

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) 

#### Description
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
* `n == height.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 104`


## Two Pointer
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int maxCapacity = 0;
        
        while(left < right){
            maxCapacity = Math.max(maxCapacity, Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
            if(height[left] < height[right])
                left++;
            else 
                right--;
        }
        
        return maxCapacity;
    }
}
```

### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Brilliant!

## Two Pointer (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        max_water = 0
        while left < right:
            max_water = max(max_water, min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left))
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return max_water
```
