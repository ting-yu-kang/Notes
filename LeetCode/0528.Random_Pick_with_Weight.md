# 528. Random Pick with Weight

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

#### Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the **weight** of the `ith` index.

You need to implement the function `pickIndex()`, which **randomly** picks an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]` (**inclusive**) and returns it. The **probability** of picking an index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

* For example, if `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e., `25%`), and the probability of picking index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e., `75%`).

#### Example 1:
```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= w.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
* `pickIndex` will be called at most `10^4` times.

## random.choices
```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.weights = w
        
    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        return random.choices(range(len(self.weights)), weights = self.weights, k = 1)[0]


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```
### Time complexity
* O(n + log(w))
* n build cumulative weights
* log(w) binary search
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark

## linear scan
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        n = len(w)
        self.cum_weights = [0] * n
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += w[i]
            self.cum_weights[i] = prefix_sum

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        rand = random.random() * self.cum_weights[-1]
        for i in range(len(self.cum_weights)):
            if self.cum_weights[i] > rand:
                return i
        
        return -1


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```
### Time complexity
* O(n + w)
* n build cumulative weights
* w linear search
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark

## binary search
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        n = len(w)
        self.cum_weights = [0] * n
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += w[i]
            self.cum_weights[i] = prefix_sum

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        rand = random.random() * self.cum_weights[-1]
        
        return bisect.bisect_right(self.cum_weights, rand)
```
### Time complexity
* O(n + log(w))
* n build cumulative weights
* log(w) binary search
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* use bisect right to find the index of right insertion

## binary search (customized)
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        n = len(w)
        self.cum_weights = [0] * n
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += w[i]
            self.cum_weights[i] = prefix_sum

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        target = random.random() * self.cum_weights[-1]
        start = 0
        end = len(self.cum_weights)
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if self.cum_weights[mid] <= target:
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return start


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```
