# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) 

#### Description
Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

#### Note:
Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

#### Example:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## Two pointer
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        
        while(start < end){
            int sum = nums[start] + nums[end];
            if(sum < target){
                start++;
            }
            else if(sum > target){
                end--;
            }
            else{
                return new int[]{start + 1, end + 1};
            }
        }
        
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
}
```

### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Might need to consider overflow case
