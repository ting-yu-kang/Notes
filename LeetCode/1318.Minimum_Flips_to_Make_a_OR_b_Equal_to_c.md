# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/)

#### Description
Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make ( `a` OR `b` == `c` ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change **any** single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/06/sample_3_1676.png)
```
Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= a <= 10^9`
* `1 <= b <= 10^9`
* `1 <= c <= 10^9`

## Shift
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while a != 0 or b != 0 or c != 0:
            bit_a, bit_b, bit_c = a & 1, b & 1, c & 1
            if bit_a == 0 and bit_b == 0 and bit_c == 1:
                count += 1
            if bit_a == 1 and bit_c == 0:
                count += 1
            if bit_b == 1 and bit_c == 0:
                count += 1
            
            a >>= 1
            b >>= 1
            c >>= 1

        return count
```
### Time complexity
* O(log(max(a, b, c)))
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark

## XOR + count bit
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        diff = (a | b) ^ c
        extra = (a & b) & diff

        return self.__count_bit(diff) + self.__count_bit(extra)

    def __count_bit(self, num):
        count = 0
        while num:
            count += 1
            num &= (num - 1)
        
        return count
```
