# 12. Integer to Roman

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

#### Description
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```
#### Example 4:
```
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```
#### Example 5:
```
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Keep substracting
```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        int nums[] = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};
        String romes[] = {"M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"};
        StringBuilder ret = new StringBuilder();
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < nums.length ; i++){
            while(num >= nums[i]){
                ret.append(romes[i]);
                num -= nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return ret.toString();
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O()
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark

## Decouple digits
```java
class Solution {
    String M[] = {"", "M", "MM", "MMM"};
    String C[] = {"", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM"};
    String X[] = {"", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC"};
    String I[] = {"", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"};
    
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        return M[num / 1000 % 10] + C[num / 100 % 10] + X[num / 10 % 10] + I[num % 10];
    }
}
```
