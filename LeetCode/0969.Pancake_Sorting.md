# 969. Pancake Sorting

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting/)

#### Description
Given an array `A`, we can perform a *pancake flip*: We choose some positive integer `k <= A.length`, then reverse the order of the first **k** elements of `A`.  We want to perform zero or more pancake flips (doing them one after another in succession) to sort the array `A`.

Return the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `A`.  Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * A.length` flips will be judged as correct.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k=4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k=2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k=4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k=3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted. 
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

#### Note:
1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `A[i]` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., A.length]`

## flip twice
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> pancakeSort(int[] A) {
        if(A == null || A.length == 0)
            return new ArrayList<>();
        
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int level = A.length - 1 ; level >= 0 ; level--){
            int maxIdx = 0;
            int max = A[0];
            for(int i = 0 ; i <= level ; i++){
                if(A[i] > max){
                    max = A[i];
                    maxIdx = i;
                }
            }
            if(maxIdx == level)
                continue;
            ans.add(maxIdx + 1);
            flip(A, maxIdx + 1);
            ans.add(level + 1);
            flip(A, level + 1);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
    
    private void flip(int[] A, int k){
        for(int i = 0 ; i < k / 2 ; i++){
            int tmp = A[i];
            A[i] = A[k - i - 1];
            A[k - i - 1] = tmp;
        }
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(N^2)
* 2N flips
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* flip the largest to the top, and then flip all elements to let it be the bottom.
