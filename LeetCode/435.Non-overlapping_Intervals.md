# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

#### Description
Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`

## Greedy
```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
        last_end = -sys.maxsize - 1
        remove_count = 0
        for now_start, now_end in intervals:
            if now_start < last_end:
                remove_count += 1
            else:
                last_end = now_end
        return remove_count
```
### Time complexity
* O(nlogn)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Who can think of that??

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        last_end = -sys.maxsize - 1
        remove_count = 0
        for now_start, now_end in intervals:
            if now_start < last_end:
                remove_count += 1
                last_end = min(last_end, now_end)
            else:
                last_end = now_end
        return remove_count
```
### Time complexity
* O(nlogn)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* More intuitive. Sory by start and if there is conflict, only keep the one with smaller end
