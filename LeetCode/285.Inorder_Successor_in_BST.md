# 285. Inorder Successor in BST

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/) 

#### Description
Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG)
```
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
```

#### Note:
1. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.
2. It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.

## Sol1
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode now = root;
        TreeNode next = null;
        while(now != null){
            if(p.val >= now.val)
                now = now.right;
            else{
                next = now;
                now = now.left;
            }
        }
        return next;
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(log(n))
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* brilliant!
* right: do nothing
* left: record next

## Sol2
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode now = root;
        TreeNode next = null;
        while(now != p){
            if(p.val > now.val)
                now = now.right;
            else{
                next = now;
                now = now.left;
            }
        }
        
        if(now.right == null)
            return next;
        
        now = now.right;
        while(now.left != null){
            now = now.left;
        }
        return now;
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(log(n))
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* first go to the node
* if right exist, go right and go deep left
