# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

#### Description
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return *the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

#### Constraints:
* 1 <= points.length <= 10^5
* points[i].length == 2
* -2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1

## Greedy
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key = lambda x : x[0])
        count = 0
        last_right = -sys.maxsize-1
        for now_left, now_right in points:
            if now_left <= last_right: # overlap
                last_right = min(now_right, last_right)
            else: # not overlap
                count += 1
                last_right = now_right

        return count
```
### Time complexity
* O(nlogn)
### Space complexity
* `O(n)` for python Timsort and `O(logn)` for java quicksort(recursion stack)
### Remark
* Sort by start, and update last_end to the smaller end when 2 intervals overlap.
