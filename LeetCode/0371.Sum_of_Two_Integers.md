# 371. Sum of Two Integers

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

#### Description
Given two integers `a` and `b`, return *the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
```

#### Constraints:
* `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

## XOR and Carry/Borrow
```python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        x, y = abs(a), abs(b)
        if x < y:
            return self.getSum(b, a)

        sign = 1 if a >= 0 else -1
        
        if a * b >= 0:
            while y != 0:
                xor = x ^ y
                carry = (x & y) << 1
                x, y = xor, carry
        else:
            while y != 0:
                xor = x ^ y
                borrow = (~x & y) << 1
                x, y = xor, borrow

        return sign * x
```
### Time complexity
* O(1), it may take at most number of bits of while loops though
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Pretty tricky. There is a more simplified solution that I don't think worth investigating time.
