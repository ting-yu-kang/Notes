# 207. Course Schedule

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

#### Description
There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

#### Note:
1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.


## BFS (Topological Sort)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        Node[] graph = new Node[numCourses];
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < graph.length ; i++){
            graph[i] = new Node();
        }
        for(int[] prereq : prerequisites){
            int a = prereq[1];
            int b = prereq[0];
            graph[a].next.add(graph[b]);
            graph[b].inDegree++;
        }
        for(Node now : graph){
            if(now.inDegree == 0)
                queue.addLast(now);
        }
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            Node now = queue.removeFirst();
            count++;
            for(Node next : now.next){
                next.inDegree--;
                if(next.inDegree == 0)
                    queue.addLast(next);
            }
        }
        return count == numCourses;
    }
    
    private class Node{
        public int inDegree;
        public List<Node> next;
        
        public Node(){
            this.inDegree = 0;
            this.next = new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(n + m)
* n : numOfCourses
* m : prerequisites.length
### Space complexity
* O(n)
