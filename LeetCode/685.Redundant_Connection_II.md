685. Redundant Connection II

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/solution/) 

#### Description
In this problem, a rooted tree is a **directed** graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[u, v]` that represents a **directed** edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`, where `u` is a parent of child `v`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
v   v
2-->3
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,1], [1,5]]
Output: [4,1]
Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
5 <- 1 -> 2
     ^    |
     |    v
     4 <- 3
```

#### Note
* The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
* Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

## UnionFind
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findRedundantDirectedConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int[] parents = new int[edges.length + 1];
        int[] candidate1 = {-1, -1};
        int[] candidate2 = {-1, -1};
        for(int[] edge : edges){
            if(parents[edge[1]] == 0)
                parents[edge[1]] = edge[0];
            else{
                //find a node with two parent
                candidate1 = new int[]{parents[edge[1]], edge[1]};
                candidate2 = new int[]{edge[0], edge[1]};
                //invalid the second edge(candidate2)
                edge[1] = 0;
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < parents.length ; i++){
            parents[i] = i;
        }
        
        for(int[] edge : edges){
            int parent = edge[0];
            int child = edge[1];
            if(child == 0)
                continue;
            //check if there is a cycle
            if(root(parent, parents) == child){
                //if there are no candidate, just remove the last edge that makes the cycle
                if(candidate1[0] == -1)
                    return edge;
                //if there are condidates, it means that the candidate1 should be the edge to be removed
                else
                    return candidate1;
            }
            parents[child] = parent;
        }
        //Valid, candidate2 is the right answer
        return candidate2;
    }
    
    private int root(int a, int[] parents){
        if(parents[a] != a)
            parents[a] = root(parents[a], parents);
        return parents[a];
    }
}

### Time complexity
* O(n), not really sure
### Space complexity
* O(n), parent
### Remark
* Hard.
* The invalid situation: two parent or cycle
    1. two parent but no cycle:\
    remove candidate2
    2. two parent with cycle:\
    remove candidate2 to see if there is still cycle
        * still cycle -> return candidate1
        * no cycle -> return candidate2
    3. one parent with cycle:\
    remove the last one that form the cycle
    4. one parent but no cycle
    valid
