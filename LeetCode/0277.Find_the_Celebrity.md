# 277. Find the Celebrity

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/)

#### Description
Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given an integer `n` and a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Note** that the `n x n` 2D array `graph` given as input is not directly available to you, and instead only accessible through the helper function `knows`. `graph[i][j] == 1` represents person `i` knows person `j`, wherease `graph[i][j] == 0` represents person `j` does not know person `i`.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/g1.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/19/g2.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.
```

#### Constraints:
* `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
* `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

## knockout stage (打擂台)
```java
/* The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
      boolean knows(int a, int b); */

public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int candidate = 0;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++){
            if(knows(candidate, i))
                candidate = i;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            if(i == candidate)
                continue;
            if(knows(candidate, i) || !knows(i, candidate))
                return -1;
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Brilliant!
* Each comparison will eliminate one element

## Eliminate one at a time (python)
```python
# The knows API is already defined for you.
# return a bool, whether a knows b
# def knows(a: int, b: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def findCelebrity(self, n: int) -> int:
        candidate = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if knows(candidate, i):
                candidate = i

        for i in range(n):
            if i == candidate:
                continue
            if not knows(i, candidate) or knows(candidate, i):
                return -1

        return candidate
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* Brilliant!
* n - 1 comparison to eliminate n - 1 and get the only possible candidate
* 2 (n - 1) comparison to verify if the candidate is the celebrity
