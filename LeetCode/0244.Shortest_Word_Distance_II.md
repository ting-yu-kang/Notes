# 244. Shortest Word Distance II

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/XXX/)

#### Description
Design a data structure that will be initialized with a string array, and then it should answer queries of the shortest distance between two different strings from the array.

Implement the `WordDistance` class:

* `WordDistance(String[] wordsDict)` initializes the object with the strings array `wordsDict`.
* `int shortest(String word1, String word2)` returns the shortest distance between `word1` and `word2` in the array `wordsDict`.


#### Example 1:
```
Input
["WordDistance", "shortest", "shortest"]
[[["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]], ["coding", "practice"], ["makes", "coding"]]
Output
[null, 3, 1]

Explanation
WordDistance wordDistance = new WordDistance(["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]);
wordDistance.shortest("coding", "practice"); // return 3
wordDistance.shortest("makes", "coding");    // return 1
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= wordsDict.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10`
* `wordsDict[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `word1` and `word2` are in `wordsDict`.
* `word1 != word2`
* At most `5000` calls will be made to `shortest`.

## Two Pointers
```python
class WordDistance:

    def __init__(self, wordsDict: List[str]):
        self.locations = {}
        for i, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
            if word not in self.locations:
                self.locations[word] = []
            self.locations[word].append(i)

    def shortest(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        loc1 = self.locations[word1]
        loc2 = self.locations[word2]

        i = j = 0
        min_dist = sys.maxsize
        while i < len(loc1) and j < len(loc2):
            min_dist = min(min_dist, abs(loc1[i] - loc2[j]))
            if loc1[i] < loc2[j]:
                i += 1
            elif loc1[i] > loc2[j]:
                j += 1
            else:
                return 0

        return min_dist



# Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordDistance(wordsDict)
# param_1 = obj.shortest(word1,word2)
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* either move i or j depending on which is bigger
