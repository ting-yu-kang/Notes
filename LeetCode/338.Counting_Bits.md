# 338. Counting Bits

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

#### Description
Given an integer `n`, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

#### Constraints:
* `0 <= n <= 10^5`

#### Follow up:

* It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
* Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?

## DP
```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        ret = [0] * (n + 1)
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            ret[num] = ret[num >> 1] + (num & 1)

        return ret
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* f(n) = f(n / 2) + n mod 2

## DP 2
```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        ret = [0] * (n + 1)
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            ret[num] = ret[num & (num - 1)] + 1

        return ret
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* f(n) = f(n & (n - 1)) + 1
* n & (n - 1) removes the rightmost bit, and since it's always smaller than n, we can leverge this trick for dp
