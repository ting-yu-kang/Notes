# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

#### Description
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most* `k` `0`'s.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `0 <= k <= nums.length`

## Sliding Window
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        zero_count = 0
        max_zero_count = 0
        left = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zero_count += 1

            while zero_count > k:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zero_count -= 1
                left += 1

            max_zero_count = max(max_zero_count, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_zero_count
```
