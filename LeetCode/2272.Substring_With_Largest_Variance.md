# 2272. Substring With Largest Variance

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-largest-variance/)

#### Description
The **variance** of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of **any** `2` characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters only, return *the **largest variance** possible among all **substrings** of `s`*.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aababbb"
Output: 3
Explanation:
All possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed below:
- Variance 0 for substrings "a", "aa", "ab", "abab", "aababb", "ba", "b", "bb", and "bbb".
- Variance 1 for substrings "aab", "aba", "abb", "aabab", "ababb", "aababbb", and "bab".
- Variance 2 for substrings "aaba", "ababbb", "abbb", and "babb".
- Variance 3 for substring "babbb".
Since the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abcde"
Output: 0
Explanation:
No letter occurs more than once in s, so the variance of every substring is 0.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Kadane's algorithm
```python
class Solution:
    def largestVariance(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = {}
        for c in s:
            count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1

        max_sum = 0
        for c1 in count:
            for c2 in count:
                if c1 == c2:
                    continue
                remain_count2 = count[c2]
                max_so_far = 0
                count1 = count2 = 0
                for c in s:
                    if c == c1:
                        count1 += 1
                    if c == c2:
                        count2 += 1
                        remain_count2 -= 1
                    if count1 > 0 and count2 > 0:
                        max_sum = max(count1 - count2, max_sum)
                    
                    if count1 < count2 and remain_count2 > 0:
                        count1, count2 = 0, 0

        return max_sum
```
### Time complexity
* O(n * 26 * 26)
### Space complexity
* O(26) = O(1)
### Remark
* convert the problem to pairs of characters with 1 and -1 and find the max sum
