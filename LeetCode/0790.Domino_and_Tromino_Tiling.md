# 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)

#### Description
You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/15/lc-domino.jpg)

Given an integer n, return *the number of ways to tile an `2 x n` board*. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are shown above.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
* 1 <= n <= 1000

## Top Down
```python
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, n: int) -> int:
        self.mem_f = {1 : 1, 2 : 2}
        self.mem_p = {1 : 0, 2 : 1}
        self.mod = (10 ** 9 + 7)
        return self.__f(n)
    
    def __f(self, now):
        if now in self.mem_f:
            return self.mem_f[now]

        ans = self.__f(now - 1) + self.__f(now - 2) + self.__p(now - 1) * 2

        self.mem_f[now] = ans
        return ans % self.mod

    def __p(self, now):
        if now in self.mem_p:
            return self.mem_p[now]

        ans = self.__f(now - 2) + self.__p(now - 1)

        self.mem_p[now] = ans
        return ans % self.mod
        
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* this question needs to use 2 functions f() and p(), like state machine

## Bottom up optimized
```python
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        mod = 1_000_000_007
        fa, fb = 1, 2 
        pa, pb = 0, 1
        for _ in range(3, n + 1):
            fc = (fa + fb + pb * 2) % mod
            pc = (fa + pb) % mod
            fa, fb = fb, fc
            pa, pb = pb, pc

        return fb
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* There are more solutions including matrix exponentiation, which can achieve log(N) time complexity. Worth taking a look.
