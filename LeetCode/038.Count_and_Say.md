# 38. Count and Say

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

#### Description
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2, then one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the n^th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

## Sol
```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        StringBuilder a = new StringBuilder("1");
        StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();
        StringBuilder tmp;
        
        for(int r = 2 ; r <= n ; r++){
            for(int i = 0 ; i < a.length(); i++){
                int now = i;
                while(i < a.length() - 1 && a.charAt(i) == a.charAt(i + 1)){
                    i++;
                }
                b.append((i - now + 1) + "" + a.charAt(i));
            }
            tmp = a;
            a = b;
            b = tmp;
            b.setLength(0);
        }
        return a.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time complexity
* `O(2^n)`, each string will almost be twice as length compared to the previous one.
* not sure
### Space complexity
* `O(2^n)`, length of a + length of b
### Remark
* Only have to swap two stringbuilder
