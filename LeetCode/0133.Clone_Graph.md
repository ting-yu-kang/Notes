# 133. Clone Graph

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

#### Description
Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph.

Return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

### Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)
```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```
#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)
```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `Node.val` is unique for each node.
* There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
* The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## BFS
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null)
            return null;
        
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(node);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            Node nowNode = queue.removeFirst();
            map.put(nowNode, new Node(nowNode.val, new ArrayList<>()));
            for(Node neighbor : nowNode.neighbors){
                if(map.containsKey(neighbor))
                    continue;
                queue.addLast(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        for(Map.Entry<Node, Node> e : map.entrySet()){
            Node nowNode = e.getKey();
            Node newNode = e.getValue();
            for(Node neighbor : nowNode.neighbors){
                newNode.neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
            }
        }
        
        return map.get(node);
    }
}
```

### Space complexity

### Remark
1. node->nodes and copy nodes
3. copy edges

### Space complexity
* O(V), queue and hashmap
### Remark
* Assign visited when pushing nodes, not when popping nodes. Tree might be ok but not for graph.
