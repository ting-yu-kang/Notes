# 156. Binary Tree Upside Down

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/XXX/)

#### Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, turn the tree upside down and return *the new root*.

You can turn a binary tree upside down with the following steps:

1. The original left child becomes the new root.
2. The original root becomes the new right child.
3. The original right child becomes the new left child.

The mentioned steps are done level by level. It is **guaranteed** that every right node has a sibling (a left node with the same parent) and has no children.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/29/updown.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [4,5,2,null,null,3,1]
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 10]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10`
* Every right node in the tree has a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent).
* Every right node in the tree has no children.

## Recursion
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def upsideDownBinaryTree(self, now: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not now:
            return None
        if not now.left:
            return now

        new_root = self.upsideDownBinaryTree(now.left)
        
        now.left.left = now.right
        now.left.right = now
        now.left = None
        now.right = None

        return new_root
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* It's a left tail tree
