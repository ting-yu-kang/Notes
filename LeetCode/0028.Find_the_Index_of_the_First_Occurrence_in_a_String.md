# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

#### Description
Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`
* `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Brute Force (Sliding Window)
```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            offset = 0
            while offset < len(needle) and haystack[i + offset] == needle[offset]:
                offset += 1
            if offset == len(needle):
                return i

        return -1
```
### Time complexity
* O(M * N)
### Space complexity
* O(1)
### Remark
* We can use double hashing (Rabin-Karp algorithm) to reach O(M) complexity.
    * Since we keep substract the first character's hash value and add the next one for each window, the computation would be O(1), faster than dictionary
    * O(1) Space complexity
* There is another way of KMP algorithm with O(n) time complexity and O(m) space complexity
