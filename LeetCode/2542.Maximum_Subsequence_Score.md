# 2542. Maximum Subsequence Score

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/)

#### Description
You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and a positive integer k. You must choose a *subsequence* of indices from `nums1` of length `k`.

For chosen indices `i0`, `i1`, ..., `ik - 1`, your **score** is defined as:

* The sum of the selected elements from `nums1` multiplied with the **minimum** of the selected elements from `nums2`.
* It can defined simply as: `(nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1])`.

*Return the **maximum** possible score.*

A **subsequence** of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` by deleting some or no elements.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.
Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Choosing index 2 is optimal: nums1[2] * nums2[2] = 3 * 10 = 30 is the maximum possible score.
```

#### Constraints:
* `n == nums1.length == nums2.length`
* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 105`
* `1 <= k <= n`

## Priority Queue
```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums1)
        pair = sorted([(nums1[i], nums2[i]) for i in range(n)], key = lambda x : -x[1])
        k_heap = [x[0] for x in pair[:k]]
        sum_k = sum(k_heap)
        heapq.heapify(k_heap)

        max_score = sum_k * pair[k - 1][1]
        for i in range(k, n):
            num1, num2 = pair[i][0], pair[i][1]
            sum_k = sum_k - heapq.heappop(k_heap) + num1
            heapq.heappush(k_heap, num1)
            max_score = max(max_score, sum_k * num2)

        return max_score
```
### Time complexity
* O(nlogn)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* This is really tricky
* use a pair for nums1 and nums2 and use a priority queue to track top k
* I was thinking to start from all an remove num1, but it's too complicated. Starting from k to n and add num1 is much better.
