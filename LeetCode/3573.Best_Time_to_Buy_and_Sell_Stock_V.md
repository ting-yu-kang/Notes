# 3573. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock V

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-v/)

#### Description
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock in dollars on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to make at most `k` transactions, where each transaction can be either of the following:

* **Normal transaction**: Buy on day `i`, then sell on a later day `j` where `i < j`. You profit `prices[j] - prices[i]`.

* **Short selling transaction**: Sell on day `i`, then buy back on a later day `j` where `i < j`. You profit `prices[i] - prices[j]`.

**Note** that you must complete each transaction before starting another. Additionally, you can't buy or sell on the same day you are selling or buying back as part of a previous transaction.

Return the **maximum** total profit you can earn by making **at most** `k` transactions.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [1,7,9,8,2], k = 2

Output: 14

Explanation:

We can make $14 of profit through 2 transactions:
A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $1 then sell it on day 2 for $9.
A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $8 then buy back on day 4 for $2.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [12,16,19,19,8,1,19,13,9], k = 3

Output: 36

Explanation:

We can make $36 of profit through 3 transactions:
A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $12 then sell it on day 2 for $19.
A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $19 then buy back on day 4 for $8.
A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 5 for $1 then sell it on day 6 for $19.
```

#### Constraints:
* 2 <= prices.length <= 10^3
* 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9
* 1 <= k <= prices.length / 2

## Dynamic Programming Top Down
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumProfit(self, prices: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        memo = [[[-sys.maxsize - 1] * 3 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(k + 1)]
        return self._cal(k, 0, 0, prices, memo)

    def _cal(self, remain_round, now, state, prices, memo):
        if now == len(prices):
            return 0 if state == 0 else -sys.maxsize - 1

        if memo[remain_round][now][state + 1] != -sys.maxsize - 1:
            return memo[remain_round][now][state + 1]
            
        # do nothing
        profit = self._cal(remain_round, now + 1, state, prices, memo)

        if state == 0:
            # buy
            profit = max(profit, -prices[now] + self._cal(remain_round, now + 1, 1, prices, memo))
            # sell
            profit = max(profit, prices[now] + self._cal(remain_round, now + 1, -1, prices, memo))

        elif remain_round > 0:
            if state == 1:
                # sell
                profit = max(profit, prices[now] + self._cal(remain_round - 1, now + 1, 0, prices, memo))
            elif state == -1:
                # buy
                profit = max(profit, -prices[now] + self._cal(remain_round - 1, now + 1, 0, prices, memo))

        memo[remain_round][now][state + 1] = profit
        return profit

### Space complexity

### Remark
* maintain 3 states

## Dynamic Programming Bottom Up
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumProfit(self, prices: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        memo = [[[0] * 3 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(k + 1)]
        for _round in range(k + 1):
            memo[_round][0][0] = memo[_round][0][2] = -sys.maxsize - 1

        # 0(short), 1(x), 2(long)

        for _round in range(1, k + 1):
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                # sell close / buy close
                memo[_round][i][1] = max(memo[_round][i - 1][2] + prices[i - 1], memo[_round][i - 1][0] - prices[i - 1])
                # sell open
                memo[_round][i][0] = memo[_round - 1][i - 1][1] + prices[i - 1]
                # buy open
                memo[_round][i][2] = memo[_round - 1][i - 1][1] - prices[i - 1]

                for state in range(3): 
                    # do nothing
                    memo[_round][i][state] = max(memo[_round][i][state], memo[_round][i - 1][state])

        return memo[k][n][1]
```
### Time complexity
* O(k * n * 3)
### Space complexity
* O(k * n * 3)
### Remark
* set -max at the beginning of each round holding any position

## Dynamic Programming Optimized
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumProfit(self, prices: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        memo = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(k + 1)]
        memo_tmp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(k + 1)]
        for _round in range(k + 1):
            memo[_round][0] = memo[_round][2] = -sys.maxsize - 1

        # 0(short), 1(x), 2(long)

        for i in range(n):
            for _round in range(1, k + 1):
                # sell close / buy close
                memo_tmp[_round][1] = max(memo[_round][2] + prices[i], memo[_round][0] - prices[i])
                # sell open
                memo_tmp[_round][0] = memo[_round - 1][1] + prices[i]
                # buy open
                memo_tmp[_round][2] = memo[_round - 1][1] - prices[i]

                for state in range(3): 
                    # do nothing
                    memo_tmp[_round][state] = max(memo_tmp[_round][state], memo[_round][state])
                
            memo, memo_tmp = memo_tmp, memo

        return memo[k][1]
```
### Time complexity
* O(k * n * 3)
### Space complexity
* O(k * 3)
### Remark
* Same as IV, we can choose n or k
