# 635. Design Log Storage System

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-log-storage-system/)

#### Description
You are given several logs, where each log contains a unique ID and timestamp. Timestamp is a string that has the following format: `Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second`, for example, `2017:01:01:23:59:59`. All domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Implement the LogSystem class:

* `LogSystem()` Initializes the `LogSystem` object.
* `void put(int id, string timestamp)` Stores the given log `(id, timestamp)` in your storage system.
* `int[] retrieve(string start, string end, string granularity)` Returns the IDs of the logs whose timestamps are within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive. `start` and `end` all have the same format as `timestamp`, and `granularity` means how precise the range should be (i.e. to the exact `Day`, `Minute`, etc.). For example, `start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59"`, `end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59"`, and `granularity = "Day"` means that we need to find the logs within the inclusive range from **Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd 2017**, and the `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second` for each log entry can be ignored.

#### Example 1:
```
Input
["LogSystem", "put", "put", "put", "retrieve", "retrieve"]
[[], [1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59"], [2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59"], [3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00"], ["2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year"], ["2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour"]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, [3, 2, 1], [2, 1]]

Explanation
LogSystem logSystem = new LogSystem();
logSystem.put(1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59");
logSystem.put(2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59");
logSystem.put(3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00");

// return [3,2,1], because you need to return all logs between 2016 and 2017.
logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year");

// return [2,1], because you need to return all logs between Jan. 1, 2016 01:XX:XX and Jan. 1, 2017 23:XX:XX.
// Log 3 is not returned because Jan. 1, 2016 00:00:00 comes before the start of the range.
logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour");
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= id <= 500`
* `2000 <= Year <= 2017`
* `1 <= Month <= 12`
* `1 <= Day <= 31`
* `0 <= Hour <= 23`
* `0 <= Minute, Second <= 59`
* `granularity` is one of the values `["Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Minute", "Second"].`
* At most `500` calls will be made to `put` and `retrieve`.

## Solution
```python
class LogSystem:

    def __init__(self):
        self.logs = []
        self.granularity_map = { "Year": 4, "Month": 7, "Day": 10, "Hour": 13, "Minute": 16, "Second": 19 }
        
    def put(self, id: int, timestamp: str) -> None:
        self.logs.append((id, timestamp))

    def retrieve(self, start: str, end: str, granularity: str) -> List[int]:
        idx = self.granularity_map[granularity]
        ans = []
        for id, timestamp in self.logs:
            if start[:idx] <= timestamp[:idx] <= end[:idx]:
                ans.append(id)
                
        return ans


# Your LogSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = LogSystem()
# obj.put(id,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.retrieve(start,end,granularity)
```
### Time complexity
* put: O(1)
* retrieve: O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(n)
### Remark
* truncate string based on granularity
