# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

#### Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return *the number that I picked.*

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
* `1 <= pick <= n`

```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        start, end = 1, n

        while start <= end:
            mid = start + ((end - start) // 2)
            g = guess(mid)
            if g == 1:
                start = mid + 1
            elif g == -1:
                end = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
            
        return -1
