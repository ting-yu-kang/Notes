# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/) 

#### Description
Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

#### Note: 
A leaf is a node with no children.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

## DFS
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int ans;
    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        ans = 0;
        dfs(root, 0);
        return ans;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode now, int sum){
        if(now == null)
            return;
        sum = 10 * sum + now.val;
        if(now.left == null && now.right == null)
            ans += sum;
        dfs(now.left, sum);
        dfs(now.right, sum);
    }
}
```
