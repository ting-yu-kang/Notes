# 133. Clone Graph

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

#### Description
Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

#### Example:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113_sample.png)
```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
```

#### Node:
1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a `simple graph`, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

## BFS
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null)
            return null;
        
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(node);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            Node nowNode = queue.removeFirst();
            map.put(nowNode, new Node(nowNode.val, new ArrayList<>()));
            for(Node neighbor : nowNode.neighbors){
                if(map.containsKey(neighbor))
                    continue;
                queue.addLast(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        for(Map.Entry<Node, Node> e : map.entrySet()){
            Node nowNode = e.getKey();
            Node newNode = e.getValue();
            for(Node neighbor : nowNode.neighbors){
                newNode.neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
            }
        }
        
        return map.get(node);
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(V + E)
### Space complexity
* O(V + E)
### Remark
1. node->nodes and copy nodes
3. copy edges
