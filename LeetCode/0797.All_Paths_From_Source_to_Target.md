# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)

#### Description
Given a directed, acyclic graph of `N` nodes.  Find all possible paths from node `0` to node `N-1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.

#### Example:
```
Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
Explanation: The graph looks like this:
0--->1
|    |
v    v
2--->3
There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

#### Note:
* The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range `[2, 15]`
* You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.

## DFS
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        if(graph == null || graph.length == 0){
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
            
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> tmp = new ArrayList<>();
        tmp.add(0);
        dfs(ans, tmp, graph, 0);
        return ans;
    }
    
    private void dfs(List<List<Integer>> ans, List<Integer> tmp, int[][] graph, int now){
        if(now == graph.length - 1){
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>(tmp));
            return;
        }
        
        for(int next : graph[now]){
            tmp.add(next);
            dfs(ans, tmp, graph, next);
            tmp.remove(tmp.size() - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
### Time complexity
* O(n * 2^n)
* for each path from source to destination, at most we can choose each node to appear or not
### Space complexity
* O(n * 2^n)
### Remark
* acyclic graph, no need to keep track of visit array
