# 743. Network Delay Time

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)

#### Description
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return *the **minimum** time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal*. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/23/931_example_1.png)
```
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
Output: 1
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
Output: -1
```

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= k <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= times.length <= 6000`
* `times[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
* `ui != vi`
* `0 <= wi <= 100`
* All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are **unique**. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

## Dijkstra
```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = {}
        for start, end, time in times:
            if start not in graph:
                graph[start] = []
            graph[start].append((end, time))
        heap = []
        heapq.heappush(heap, (0, k))
        receive_time = [sys.maxsize] * (n + 1)
        receive_time[0] = 0

        while heap:
            time_now, now = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if receive_time[now] < time_now:
                continue
            receive_time[now] = time_now
            if now not in graph:
                continue
            for next, time_next in graph[now]:
                if time_now + time_next < receive_time[next]:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (time_now + time_next, next))

        max_receive_time = max(receive_time)
        if max_receive_time == sys.maxsize:
            return -1
        return max_receive_time
```
### Time complexity
* O(V + ElogE)
### Space complexity
* O(V + E)
