# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

#### [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)

#### Description
Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -> aecdb
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

#### Example 1:
```
```
#### Example 2:
```
```
#### Example 3:
```
```

#### Constraints:

## HashMap + Sort
```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # exactly same character set
        # same character count combination
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False

        char_count1 = {}
        char_count2 = {}

        for c1 in word1:
            char_count1[c1] = char_count1.get(c1, 0) + 1
        for c2 in word2:
            char_count2[c2] = char_count2.get(c2, 0) + 1

        if char_count1.keys() != char_count2.keys():
            return False

        if sorted(char_count1.values()) != sorted(char_count2.values()):
            return False

        return True
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1), essentially only 26 characters
### Remark
* Can also use 2 more hash map rather than sorting the list, but since there are only 26 chars, sorting is fast.
* Counter is significantly faster than manual hash map

## Frequency Array
```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # exactly same character set
        # same character count combination
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False


        char_count1 = [ 0 ] * 26
        char_count2 = [ 0 ] * 26

        for c1 in word1:
            char_count1[ord(c1) - ord("a")] += 1
        for c2 in word2:
            char_count2[ord(c2) - ord("a")] += 1

        for i in range (26):
            if char_count1[i] == 0 and char_count2[i] != 0:
                return False
            if char_count1[i] != 0 and char_count2[i] == 0:
                return False

        char_count1.sort()
        char_count2.sort()

        return True if char_count1 == char_count2 else False
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1), essentially only 26 characters
### Remark
* similar approach to #1, but it doesn't create new list so save more space

## Counter
```Python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # exactly same character set
        # same character count combination
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False

        counter1 = Counter(word1)
        counter2 = Counter(word2)

        return counter1.keys() == counter2.keys() and sorted(counter1.values()) == sorted(counter2.values())
```
### Time complexity
* O(n)
### Space complexity
* O(1), essentially only 26 characters
### Remark
* Counter is significantly faster than manual hash map, as it's using native C loops.
